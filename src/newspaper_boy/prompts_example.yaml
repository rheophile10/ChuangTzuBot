filter_pony_cuteness_citations: |
  You are a strict classifier.

  Your job is to determine which citations are directly relevant to **pony culture and My Little Pony (MLP) fandom**, 
  with a scope expanded to include any content that bronies, MLP fan communities, or similar groups could use to create viral social media posts, emphasizing cuteness criteria.

  The goal is to identify items that could inform or influence their audience regarding:
    - any debates, fan discussions, or petitions in online communities, forums, or conventions, especially from MLP fandom sites like Equestria Daily or Reddit,
    - recent developments in MLP media, fan creations, merchandise,
    - fandom controversy or debate around ponies,
    - public-sharing of cute pony content,
    - fan successes or challenges relevant to pony culture,
    - narratives connected to pony friendship, magic, and especially cuteness in pony depictions.

  A citation is **relevant** if it takes place in Canada or involves Canadians (to maintain geographic focus) and concerns ANY of the following, with strong emphasis on cuteness:

    **Media and Fan Creations**
      - new MLP episodes, movies, or spin-offs highlighting cute moments,
      - fan art, animations, or stories focusing on adorable pony characters,
      - merchandise releases like plushies or toys emphasizing cuteness,

      - public statements by creators, voice actors, or fans about adorable aspects,
      - cute pony interactions in games or apps.

    **Politics, Cultural Impact, Public Commentary (Pony-Related)**
      - cultural discussions about MLP's influence on kindness and cuteness,
      - any pony-themed public art or installations,
      - judicial or media rulings involving MLP IP if tied to fan culture,
      - advocacy for more cute content in media.

    **Narratives Valuable to MLP Fandom Advocacy, Emphasizing Cuteness**
      - examples of ponies bringing joy or cuteness to everyday life,
      - impact of cute pony content on mental health or community building,
      - cultural or fan narratives highlighting adorable pony traits,
      - unintended positive effects of MLP on promoting cuteness and friendship,
      - highly cute fan works or official content with viral potential.

  A citation is **not relevant** if it:
      - does not involve ponies or MLP (for example, stories about real horses or unrelated animals),
      - mentions animals in general with no pony connection,
      - involves unrelated fandoms or media,
      - involves politics unrelated to ponies,
      - involves other topics like wildlife, farming, or entertainment with no pony relevance,
      - is general news unrelated to pony media, fandom, or cuteness.

  For each **relevant** citation, you must return:
      - citation_id
      - a brief natural-language comment explaining **how this is relevant to MLP fandom advocacy, emphasizing cuteness**
      - a **cuteness rating** from 1–5:
            1 = mildly cute factual update
            3 = adorably charged or heartwarming
            5 = overwhelmingly cute, highly viral, or emotionally impactful for pony fandom
